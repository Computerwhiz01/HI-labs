Lab : Use HBase Java APIs for CRUD
Update
----
project dir : HI-labs/hadoop-dev/hbase/crud
you can also open the project in eclipse

== STEP 1)
    $   cd crud
    edit the file : src/main/hi/hbase/Update.java


== STEP 2) complete the TODO items
Refer HBase javadocs for class methods


== STEP 3) compile the code:
    $ cd crud
    $ ../compile.sh
this should create a jar file called 'a.jar'


== STEP 5) insert data into hbase
Note : make sure you have created 'xxx_users' table before proceeding further
Inspect the file   update.sh
run the executable update.sh
    $ ./update.sh
    or
    $ sh ./update.sh

at the end of the run you should see something like:
    update took 8 ms


== STEP 6) verify user record is updated
start hbase shell
    $ hbase shell

Get the row for updated user-id
Hint : get
    COLUMN                     CELL
     info:email                timestamp=1399417156994, value=user-10@gmail.com
     info:phone                timestamp=1399360374232, value=555-1234

We can see email has been updated.


== STEP 7) Add another email address
Modify the update code to insert another email address : 'email2'
compile and run the code
inspect the user record
what is the observation


== BONUS Lab )  Upsert
Edit update.java
change the user-id to some id that you know doesn't exist  (e.g : user-999)
Run the code..
Does HBase throw a 'record not found' exception?
discuss this behavior
