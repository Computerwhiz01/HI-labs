Lab : Use HBase Java APIs for connecting
Connect
----
project dir : HI-labs/hadoop-dev/hbase/crud
you can also open the project in eclipse

== STEP 1)
    $   cd crud
    edit the file : src/main/hi/hbase/Connect.java


== STEP 2) complete the TODO items


== STEP 3) compile the code:
    $ cd crud
    $ ../compile.sh
this should create a jar file called 'a.jar'


== STEP 5) Connect to HBase
Note : make sure you have created 'xxx_users' table before proceeding further
Inspect the file   connect.sh
run the executable connect.sh
    $ ./connect.sh
    or
    $ sh ./connect.sh

at the end of the run you should see something like:
    connected to sujee_users


== STEP 6) Inspect the console output
zookeeper connections?


== BONUS Lab ) measure connection latency
Find out how much time it takes to establish a connection
You can use the following Java code
    long  t1 = System.currentTimeMillis();
    // establish connection
    long  t2 = System.currentTimeMillis();
    System.out.println ("connection took : " + (t2 - t1) + " ms");
