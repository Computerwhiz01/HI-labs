Lab : Billing using HCatalog and Pig
location : hadoop-dev/hcatalog

pre-requisites for this lab:
	1) you should have billing data in  <your name>/billing/in  directory
	2) hadoop-dev/pig/billing
	3) hadoop-dev/hive/billing


== STEP 1) create billing table 
Note : If you already have a billing table, you can skip this step

Edit file : ../hive/billing/create_table_billing_ext.q 
Fix TODO items.
Execute the script as follows
	$   hive -f   ../hive/billing/create_table_billing_ext.q 


== STEP 2) create invoicing table
Note : If you already have a invoices table, you can skip this step
Edit file : ../hive/billing/create_table_invoices_ext.q 
Fix TODO items.
Execute the script as follows
	$   hive -f   ../hive/billing/create_table_invoices_ext.q


== STEP 3) Use hcat to verify the tables
Use 'hcat' command to list the tables (use -e option)

Also use hcat command to inspect schemas of both  <yourname>_billing  and <yourname>_invoices  tables  (hint use 'describe')


== STEP 4) Use Pig + HCat to calculate invoices
Start with pig billing solution : pig/billing/billing.pig
(Instructor can provide solution for pig billing as starting point)

Copy this file as : hcat-billing.pig
	$   cp  ../pig/billing/billing.pig   hcat-billing.pig


Instead of specifying schema during LOAD lets use HCatLoder
Modify the load as follows
	A = load '___your billing table name____' using org.apache.hcatalog.pig.HCatLoader();


Also modify the final STORE command to use HCatalog.
Class is : org.apache.hcatalog.pig.HCatStorer()


== STEP 5) execute the pig script as follows
	$   pig -useHCatalog  hcat-billing.pig

What is the output?
Make necessary changes to get the script running.


== STEP 6) Run the pig script again.
What is the output?
How can we fix this?

== BONUS Lab )
Modify the pig script so it over-writes previous results, without throwing an error.
Hint : look at file commands here : http://pig.apache.org/docs/r0.8.1/piglatin_ref2.html
