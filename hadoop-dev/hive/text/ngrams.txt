NGram Analysis of text documents
----------

We will use the 'books' (<your_name>_books) for the analysis.
TODO : adjust  '<your_name>'

== STEP 1)
Find the most occuring bigrams (two) in text
    $  hive -e 'SELECT ngrams(sentences(lower(line)), 2, 20 ) FROM <your name>_books'

Note : The output will be a json structure, it is hard to read
Use http://jsoneditor.appspot.com/  to pretty-up the output
(copy & paste the hive output into json editor)

Note : What are the top bi-grams?
Do they offer any insights?
Hint : these are called stop words (or filler words)

== STEP 2)
Find context n-grams occuring around word(s)

What words follow the word 'whale'
    $  hive -e 'SELECT context_ngrams(sentences(lower(line)), array("whale", null), 30) FROM <your name>_books'


== STEP 3)
what are the top adjectives used to describe 'whale'
    $  hive -e 'SELECT context_ngrams(sentences(lower(line)), array(null, "whale"), 30) FROM <your name>_books'
