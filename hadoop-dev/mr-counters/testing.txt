Lab : introduction to counters -- testing
project dir : mr-counters
you can also open the project in eclipse

We want to inspect the counters programatically and fire off alerts.


== STEP 1)
    go ahead and run the lab specified in 'readme.txt'.
    and take a note of BAD_RECORDS counter value (either on jobtracker ui or command line)



== STEP 2)
    lets get the counter value for BAD_RECORDS programatically
    The command we want is
        hadoop job -counter  <job id> <group name>   <counter name>

    the group name is : hi.mr.Counter$MyMapper$Counters'
    the counter name is : BAD_RECORDS
    job id can be found on console or from job tracker UI.
    It has the format of 'job_timestamp_counter'

    for hadoop 1
        $  hadoop job -counter <job id>  'hi.mr.Counter$MyMapper$Counters'   'BAD_RECORDS'

    for hadoop 2
        $  mapred job -counter <job id>  'hi.mr.Counter$MyMapper$Counters'   'BAD_RECORDS'

    NOTE : always sorround counter names with single quotes (') ;   not with double quotes (").
    why?


== STEP 3)
    lets complete a script, that will monitor BAD_RECORDS counter and may be fire off an alert
    inspect script : test.sh
    complete TODO items

    can you get the script to print  FAIL / PASS ?


== BONUS 1)
    if the script fail,  send off an email
    hint : use 'mail' command
         mail -s 'counter test failed'  you@example.com  << EOF
         Oops, counter test failed
         -- your friendly admin
         EOF


==  BONUS 2)
    so far we have been able to compare BAD_RECORDS to a specific number.
    How about pegging it to total number of inputs?
    For example, raise an alert of more than 1% of records are bad

    To do this, we need to count 'total records'.  This is a system counter.
    Look at 'counters.txt' file to find the appropriate counter name

    Once you figure out total number of records, here is a simple calculation

    in bash:
        a=$(expr $bad_counter \* 100)
        b=$(expr $a \/ $total_records)
        echo $b


== BONUS 3) Checking BAD_RECORDS percentage in Java code.
    We want to fail the mapreduce job if a certain percentage of records are bad.
    Look at file : src/hi/mr/CounterTest.java
    Edit TODO items
