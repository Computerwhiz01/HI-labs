Introduction

In this lab we will practice measuring the performance of search engines.
We will look at the two major metrics: precision and recall.


Lab Goals:

1. Run search engine queries, with the view of measuring their metrics.
2. Calculate the precision and recall for Google and Bing.
3. Challenge task


== STEP 1) Run the query of your choice in Google. Measure precision and recall, assuming that the first page
returned contains all the results. This assumption is not far from truth, because most people only look at the first page.


== STEP 2) Run the same query in Bing. Measure precision and recall.


== STEP 3) Put the results in a comparison table:

-------------------------------
Query    |  Google  |   Bing  |           
Precision|          |         |
Recall   |          |         |
-------------------------------    


== STEP 4) Challenge: find cases where Bing outperforms Google.
